# Summary of the projects
Prediction - Training data with 108 features and around one million observations were given. All features and response variables were numeric. GLM is used to predict the response variable. Coded in python.

ImageActionIdentify - Training data with images of different type of drivers were given. Ranger package in R was used to predict distracted driving in the test data set. 

UserEvent -  Training data of different events checked-in for various locations were given. K-nearest neighbors algorithm was applied to predict where the user is likely to check in next, given the location in the test data set.
